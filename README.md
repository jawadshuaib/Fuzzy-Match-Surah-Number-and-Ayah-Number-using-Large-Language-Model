# Fuzzy Match Surah Number and Ayah Number using a Large Language Model

The Quran is composed of 114 chapters and several thousand corresponding verses. In order to search for a specific chapter and verse online, the user can choose to enter the corresponding values directly into the URL (for example: quran.com/2:36). However, sometimes, the user may enter an unpredictable format. In the past, we would need to use RegExp to match all sorts of patterns. But now, we can use a large language model (GPT-3.5 in this case) to infer the chapter and verse entered by the user. This method is more versatile if the first option fails.
